# videogames

A videogame website that stores the information about the games owned by a user. 

It uses Bootstrap and servlets.
In addition to this, this website has "voice commands". If you say register then a registration form pops up. 

If you say validate,the registration form is validated.
Voice commands:
'register', 'validate' , 'close' , 'menu items' , 'execute queries' etc.

It uses the powerful "annyang js" to validate the voice commands.
